Boombox
=======

Boombox is a simple, one-page Wordpress theme designed and crafted specifically for musicians.

This guide is intended to be all-inclusive and detailed.
If you are familiar with Wordpress it may get a bit dense but should still have the information.

This guide also assumes that you already have a web host and Wordpress set up.
If you do not, we **STRONGLY** recommend [Flywheel](http://getflywheel.com) for premium Wordpress hosting.

If you cannot find what you are looking for in the guide don't hesitate to email us for help at <support@branberg.com>

Music Embeds
------------
Boombox uses [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com) for its music embeds.
This means you need a Soundcloud account in order to add music to your Boombox-powered website.

If you do not have a Soundcloud account you can create one for free [here](https://soundcloud.com/signup).

3. Enter "Feature Type" (Single, Album, Ep, Mixtape, Other)
4. Enter "Feature Title"

6. Enter "Button Text" (EX: Purchase, Spotify, iTunes, etc.)

8. Click "Update"


Video Embeds
------------
Boombox supports both Vimeo and YouTube embeds.

To embed a Vimeo or YouTube video:
